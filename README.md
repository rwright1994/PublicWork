<em><h1>Introduction</h1></em>

Hello, my name is Robbie and this repository is for displaying any coding samples that I am looking to provide to employers. Currently I am expanding my exisiting frameworks and coding languages to supplement my current Degrees. If you are browsing this repository then please keep in mind that this is sample work and that it may be updated from time to time. If you like to use any of the templates that I will upload (this does not include any course work that was provided by Udemy) then please feel free to use them. Please see below for the structure of this repository and where you can view templates when they become available. (No longer being developed)
